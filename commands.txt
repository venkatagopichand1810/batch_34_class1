git hub

1) We have to create the github account using gmail
2) we have to create the repo, Create a new repository give the repo name
3) after creating the repo you will see a page with few commands


now go to VS CODE..create the folder and add your files 

1) git init -> it will init the git in our local
2) git status -> red color..you are not added this files
3) git add . -> this will add all the files 
4) git status -> it will show all the files in green color, means you have added all the files
5) git commit -> we have to provide the git commit message for commiting the code files which we have
  (git commit -m "your commit message name")
6) git status 
7) git remote add origin https://github.com/venkatagopichand1810/batch_34_class1.git (when you wanted to push first time)
8) git push 
9) git push --set-upstream origin master (first time)


2nd case ( alrady repo is there, and few of the codes already present in git repo)

1) do the changes
2) git status
3)
